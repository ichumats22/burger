# Burger Time!
**Overview**

A burger restaurant app following the MVC design pattern created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. This app stores the user's burger input into a database and displays each burger, along with a "Devour" button, on the left side of the page (ready to devour!). When the button is clicked, the burger moves to the right side of the page and the button's function becomes deleting the burger from the database. 

**Technologies**
  * Node & Express - server development, data routing
  * MySQL & ORM- data storage/ queries
  * Handlebars -  HTML
